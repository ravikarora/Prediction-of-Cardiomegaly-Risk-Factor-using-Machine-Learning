# Prediction-of-Cardiomegaly-Risk-Factor-using-Machine-Learning
This paper examines the utilisation of Support Vector Machine (SVM) for the purpose of predicting cardiomegaly. The results show that how medical criteria and machine learning can be used together to predict cardiomegaly in people with a high level of accuracy that matches the clinical test results.
